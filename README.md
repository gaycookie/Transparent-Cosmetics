### **Information**
This is my first mod I've ever made for Minecraft, I've been making plugins before, but I wanted to learn and experience modding too.  
So after some time trying to figure out how some things work with great help from other developers, I present.. my first mod!

This mod was made with PvE in mind and can be considered very overpowered on PvP servers.  
So when adding this to a PvP server, make sure where you start with.

Transparent Cosmetics in a mod that adds transparent "gear" to your minecraft/modpack.  
This mod uses features from [Cosmetic-Armor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cosmetic-armor-fabric "Cosmetic Armor") with [Trinkets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinkets-fabric "Trinkets").

When the items from this mod are placed inside the cosmetic slots it will hide the armor you're wearing in your armor slots.  
So you can show of your skin without having to un-equip your armor.
